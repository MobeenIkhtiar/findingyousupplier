                            * Dynamic Product ads<br />
                            Bring back hesitant customers who previously browsed your site by using dynamic product ads. If you have hundreds of thousands of products that you are selling in your ecommerce  store, dynamic ads would be a great tool for you, as there is no need to create ads for each product due to the easy to use templates. The usability of dynamic ads templates are great as the structure is already in place and all you need to do is upload photos, product names, prices and other information from your product catalogue.
                            The advantage about using dynamic ads is you can display single or multiple product ads and target the customers that had visited your site based on products they had just sitting in there cart, or even if they did go through with the purchase.
                            <br /><br />
                            * Communicate your brand story through ads<br />
                            Build relationships with your audience by sharing your brand story. Create a sequence of ads to get your key brand messages across instead of focusing on the sales. If you prefer to, use the means of video to get your brand story out. Ensure your video is short, effective, fast moving and the message is clear and understandable.
                            Here is what you may want to include in your brand story..<br />
                            - How your company started<br />
                            - The how and why behind your products and services<br />
                            - Who you and the team behind you are in the company<br />
                            - The overall concept of your web presence<br />
                            - Real customers engaging with your product or service<br />
                            <br /><br />
                            * Run retargeting campaigns<br />
                            Target the audience via Facebook retargeting campaigns that have shown interest by visiting your website and completing some step of action, such as they have added a product into their basket, added a product into their wish list, filled out an opt-in form, liked a post and so on. This tool is to target those who have made interaction with your business, but not yet completed it. By running retargeting campaigns they are more likely to convert than a new customer.
